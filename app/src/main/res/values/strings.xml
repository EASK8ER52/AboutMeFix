        Hi my name is Ernesto Acosta.
        \n\nI like to play video games, watch great tv and movies.
        \n\nI also enjoy skateboarding, as well as listening and playing
        great indie, alternative, and rock music.
        \n\nI consider myself to be a "jack of all trades", meaning I
        am not contempt with one thing.
        \n\nNot only am I into those things I mentioned above
        I am also into many other things which include but are not limited
        to, politics, history, culture, science, geography, astrology,
        physics, and of course technology.
        \n\nFurthermore, I am an atheist, all religion is mostly nonsense,
        the main one I know a quite a bit about is christianity, but I know quite a bit
        about norse mythology as well as greek mythology, mainly because they fascinate me.
        \n\nI would love to travel one day, mainly to a couple of cool places like big ben
        in the U.K.. The Eiffel Tower in Paris as well as visit Versailles. The Red Square
        in Moscow would be amazing to see, as well as the Great Pyramid of Giza, and of course
        the Great Wall of China.
        \n\nLastly my favorite color is a tie between blue and purple, and I am a huge fan
        of western european fantasy.
        \n\n
